% Exercise 3.1
\begin{exercise}
  Let $A_1,\ldots,A^n$ be independent events. Prove that $P(\cup_{i=1}^nA_i)=1-\Pi_{i=1}^n[1-P(A_i)]$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
  \begin{align*}
    P(\cup_{i=1}^nA_i) &= 1 - P(\cap_{i=1}^n A_i^c) \\
      &= 1 - \Pi_{i=1}^n P(A_i^c)  \quad(\mbox{by independence}) \\
      &= 1 - \Pi_{i=1}^n (1-P(A_i))
  \end{align*}
\end{solution}


% Exercise 3.2
\begin{exercise}
  Show that an event whose probability is either zero or one is independent of every event, and that an event that is independent of itself has probability zero or one.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
  a) Let $A\in\cF$ such that $P(A)=0$ or $P(A)=1$, and let $B\in\cF$ be an arbitrary event such that $P(B)=p\in[0, 1]$.

  For $P(A)=0$, we have $P(A\cap B)\leq P(A) = 0$ and $P(A\cap B)\leq 0$ by definition, hence $P(A\cup B) =0$. As $P(A)P(B)=0$, $P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B)$ holds for $P(A)=0$.

  For $P(A)=1$, we have $P(A\cap B)\leq P(B) = p$, and $P(A\cap B) = 1 - P(A^c\cup B^c) \geq 1 - P(A^c) - P(B^c) = 1 - 0 - (1-p) = p$, thus $P(A\cap B) = p$. As $P(A)P(B)=p$, $P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B)$ holds for $P(A)=1$ as well. \\

  b) Let $A\in\cF$ such that is independent of itself, that is $P(A)P(A) = P(A)$. Then $P(A)(P(A)-1)=0$, which has solutions $P(A)=0$ or $P(A)=1$.
\end{solution}


% Exercise 3.3
\begin{exercise}
  What is the minimum number of points a sample space must contain in order that there exist $n$ independent events $A_1,\ldots,A_n$, none of which has probability zero or one?
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
  [TODO]
