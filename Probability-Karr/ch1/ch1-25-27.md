# Chapter 1. Probability

## Exercise 1.25
Let $A_1,\ldots,A_n$ be events, and for $J\subseteq \lbrace 1,\ldots,n \rbrace$, let $B_J=\cap_{j\in J}A_j$. For $k\geq 1$, let $S_k=\Sigma_{|J|=k}P(B_J)$, where the sum is over all subsets $J$ of $\lbrace 1,\ldots,n \rbrace$ with $|J|=k$.

a) Prove the _inclusion-exclusion principle_:

$$ P(\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i) = \Sigma_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k-1}S_k .$$

b) Suppose that $P(B_J)$ depends only on $|J|$, i.e., there are numbers $q_0,\ldots,q_n$ such that $P(B_J)=q_k$ whenever $|J|=k$. (This is true, for example, in Exercise 1.15.) Prove that $S_k = \binom{n}{k} q_k$.

### Solution

a) Prove the inclusion-exclusion principle by induction is such a pain. Here we show a simpler proof by borrowing Definition 4.1 of expectation.

Using indicator functions, we have

$$ \mathbb{1}_{\cup_{i=1}^n A_i} = 1 - \mathbb{1}_{\cap_{i=1}^n A_i^c} = 1 - \prod_{i=1}^n (1 - \mathbb{1}_{A_i}) . $$

Expanding this equation, we can get

$$ \mathbb{1}_{\cup_{i=1}^n A_i} = \Sigma_{k=1}^n(-1)^{k-1}\Sigma_{|J|=k}\prod_{j\in J}\mathbb{1}_{A_j} .$$

Taking expectation from both sides tives the inclusion-exclusion principle.

b) As $\binom{n}{k}$ represents the number of combinations of choosing $k$ from $n$:

$$S_k=\Sigma_{|J|=k}P(B_J) = \Sigma_{|J|=k}q_k = \binom{n}{k}q_k. $$
