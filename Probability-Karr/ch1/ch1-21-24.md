# Chapter 1. Probability

## Exercise 1.21
Let $P$ be a probability on $\mathbb{R}$. Prove that for every $\varepsilon>0$ there is a compact set $K$ such that $P(K)>1-\varepsilon$.

### Solution

Consider compact intervals $K_n=[-n, n]$, $n\in\mathbb{N}$. As $n\to\infty$, $K_n\uparrow \mathbb{R}$ and $P(K_n)\uparrow 1$. For an arbitrary $\varepsilon>0$, there must exist a sufficiently large $n$ such that $P(K_n)>1-\varepsilon$.


## Exercise 1.22
Prove that a distribution function on $\mathbb{R}$ has at most countably many points of discontinuity.

### Solution

TODO


## Exercise 1.23
Prove that if $P(A)>0$, then the set function

$$ P_A(B) = P(B|A) $$

is a probability on $(\Omega, \cal F)$ satisfying $P_A(A^c)=0$.

### Solution

By Bayes' theorem,

$$ P_A(A^c) = \frac{P(A^c\cap A)}{P(A)} = \frac{P(\emptyset)}{P(A)} = 0. $$


## Exercise 1.24
Let $P$ be the uniform distribution on a fininte set $\Omega$ and let $A$ be a subset $\Omega$. Prove that $P(\cdot|A)$ is the uniform distribution on $A$.

### Solution

For an arbitrary set $B\subseteq A$, by Bayes' theorem,

$$ P(B|A) = \frac{P(B\cap A)}{P(A)} = \frac{P(B)}{P(A)} = \frac{|B|}{|A|}, $$

which coincides the probability of a uniform distribution on $A$.
