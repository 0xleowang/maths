# Chapter 1. Probability

## Exercise 1.21
Let $P$ be a probability on $\mathbb{R}$. Prove that for every $\varepsilon>0$ there is a compact set $K$ such that $P(K)>1-\varepsilon$.

### Solution

Consider compact intervals $K_n=[-n, n]$, $n\in\mathbb{N}$. As $n\to\infty$, $K_n\uparrow \mathbb{R}$ and $P(K_n)\uparrow 1$. For an arbitrary $\varepsilon>0$, there must exist a sufficiently large $n$ such that $P(K_n)>1-\varepsilon$.


## Exercise 1.22
Prove that a distribution function on $\mathbb{R}$ has at most countably many points of discontinuity.
